## Battle Dice

Simple dice game where you pick your dice (constructor) and play against a computer. The user puts username and age (form) for leaderboard later on. The person with a higher roll will get a check and fist person to a certain number of checks will win the game. Displays a separate page or chart that saves the results whether you win or loose (local storage). Stretch goals could be multiplayer or separate game modes.
